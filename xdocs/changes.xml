      <action dev="rgoers" type="fix" issue="VFS-216" due-to="Reetu Mutti">
        The FTP Configuration includes an option to set a timeout for the data connection, but not for the socket
        timeout. This is a problem, as idle sockets can cause your download to hang forever and never timeout.

        FTP connection is not released If exception is thrown out of FtpFileObject.doGetOutputStream().

        SftpFileObject.doListChildrenResolved() changes the working dir before doing ChannelSftp.ls() call.
        If ls() throws an exception, the current directory is not reset. All the subsequent operations that rely on the
        current dir will fail trying to change into nonexistent directory.
