Apache Commons VFS 2.1 Release Notes
--------------------------------------

The Apache Commons VFS team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Commons VFS 2.1.

Apache Commons VFS is a Virtual File System library.

New features and bug fix release.

Please note that the Clirr report shows several errors.
These may affect source compatibility.
However they should not affect binary compatibility, as explained below.

FileContent, FileName, FileObject, FileSystemManager, RandomAccessContent:
The above interfaces have been updated to add new methods.
This does not affect binary compatibility; for details please see:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-13.html#jls-13.5.3-100
The above changes may affect source compatibility.
 Changes to method parameters and return types in TarFileObject and TarFileSystem
The original parameter/return types were the following:
org.apache.commons.vfs2.provider.tar.TarEntry
org.apache.commons.vfs2.provider.tar.TarInputStream
The above were package protected, so any methods using them did not form part of the public API.
Therefore source and binary compatibility is not affected.
