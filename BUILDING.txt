Building Apache Commons VFS
  
To build Apache Commons VFS, you need a JDK implementation version 1.7 or greater, and Apache Maven 3.

To perform the license release audit, a.k.a. "RAT check", run:

mvn apache-rat:check

To perform a Clirr check, run:

mvn clirr:check -pl commons-vfs2

To build the site with Java 7, make sure you give Maven enough memory using 
MAVEN_OPTS with options appropriate for your JVM. Alternatively, you can 
build with Java 8 and not deal with MAVEN_OPTS.

To build the site, from a command line, run:

mvn clean install
mvn site
mvn site:stage

To test, run:

mvn test

Then, to test OSGi, you must first create the jars:

mvn install -DskipTests
mvn package -DskipTests

Next, you can run the tests as usual, which will pick up the jar files to use as OSGi bundles from the various target 
directories:

mvn test
