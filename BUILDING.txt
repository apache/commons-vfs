Building Apache Commons VFS
  
To build Apache Commons VFS, you need a JDK at version 8 or greater, and Apache Maven 3.2.5 or greater.

To perform the Release Audit which validate license headers (the "RAT" check), run:

mvn apache-rat:check

The Maven profile test-deploy is used for testing, a release manager will omit it when it is time to create a 
release candidate.

Build and install all jar files: 
mvn -V -Ptest-deploy -Prelease clean install -DskipTests

Validate all installed jar files and build all module sites:
mvn -V -Ptest-deploy -Prelease -P japicmp -P jacoco site

Deploy the jar files:
mvn -V -Ptest-deploy -Prelease deploy

Assemble all sites into one:
mvn -V -Ptest-deploy -Prelease site:stage
