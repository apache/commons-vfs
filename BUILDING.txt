Building Apache Commons VFS
  
To build Apache Commons VFS, you need a JDK implementation version 1.6 or greater, and Apache Maven.

To perform the license release audit, a.k.a. "RAT check", run.

mvn apache-rat:check

To perform a Clirr check on, run

mvn clirr:check -pl core

To build the site with Java 6, make sure you give Maven enough memory using 
MAVEN_OPTS with options appropriate for your JVM. Alternatively, you can 
build with Java 8 and not deal with MAVEN_OPTS.

To build the site, from a command line, run:

mvn clean install
mvn site

On Windows, use a local staging directory, for example:

mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingSiteURL=file:///%HOME%/vfs

On UNIX, use a local staging directory, for example:

mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingSiteURL=file:///$HOME/vfs

To test, run:

mvn test

Then, to test OSGi, you must first create the jars:

mvn install -DskipTests
mvn package -DskipTests

Next, you can run the tests as usual, which will pick up the jar files to use as OSGi bundles from the various target 
directories:

mvn test
